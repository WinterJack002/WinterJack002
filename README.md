Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [`MPEG-ARF`](https://www.mpeg.org/standards/MPEG-I/39/), H.264/AVC, WebRTC...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything in the word.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [`DeepSeek`](https://chat.deepseek.com/)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about *WebRTC*, *ffmpeg*, *H.264*.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: `Winter`
